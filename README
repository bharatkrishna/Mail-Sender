GMail Sender in Python/wxPython
--------------------------------

This is a tool I've made for myself in Python & used wxPython for the GUI.

Purpose/Description:
I share my mobile minutes with a friend and I send him a monthly statement by email with each person's share and with the bill attached.
To semi-automate this process I hacked up this app which would calculate each person's share, generate the stetement and send the mail without me having to go to my Gmail inbox.
